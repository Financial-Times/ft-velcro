ft-velcro
=========

A centralised store where layout rules such as module spacing and re-usable elements such as fonts, buttons, colours, headers etc are kept up-to-date and available to use.

Developers and designers, both internally and externally, will be able to reference these code and style elements so that work isn't unnecessarily duplicated and can be reproduced consistently wherever they are used across our products.

**Velcro is currently not Production-ready so should not be used without first talking to dan.searle@ft.com**

Documentation and examples are available to view [here](http://financial-times.github.io/ft-velcro/).
